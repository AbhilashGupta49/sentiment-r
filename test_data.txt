The sellers promptly answered a question I asked regarding this TV's dimesions, and it arrived exactly on time.  This TV is a great size for a bedroom or kitchen.  It was easy to set up and has a great  picture.  We're very satisfied.

This is a pretty nice little television for the kitchen.  Many reviews mention disappointment in the speakers/sound quality.  I find that the sound is satisfactory in my kitchen.  This tv has no provision for auxiliary speakers and has only one HDMI and one coax input.  But then again, I didn't buy this to be part of a entertainment center, I bought it to glance at the news while cooking dinner.

This 28" LG is an exceptional smaller-sized LED flat screen TV.  It has a remarkably sharp picture with very natural color and many options for customizing the picture and sound.  It's a good choice for placing in an entertainment center in a small room, which is how we're using ours.  The only drawback I've found is that this particular model has only one HDMI port for connecting accessories.  I had to buy an HDMI adapter unit with additional ports in order to hook-up both the HD TV cable and a DVD/Blu-Ray player.  Other than that, the TV is great and was a real bargain for the $179.00 asking price.

great fit in the semi. now good stuff. hard to find a 1080 in a smaller screen. display is outstanding and the great lg quality. no tools needed to put stand on and also very sturdy.  sound was week at intial settings but greatly improved after two different settings. very pleased.

Fits in the small space I need it for -- sound quality is not good.  Can't turn the volume up loud enough to hear in the entire room.  There doesn't appear to be the proper options on the back of the TV to attache a sound bar.

WOW...for a small counter top type TV  the picture is excellent (1080i). And for the reviewers who said the sound is deficient I have one thing to say.....get your ears examined. While the sound is not concert hall quality it is crisp and not at all muffled or garbled unlike some other small TV's I have experienced. Set up was easy following the on screen instructions and a simple call to my cable company "synced" the TV to my cable box and viola, up and running in less that 10 minutes. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this TV.

I needed a small TV for my kitchen and this fits perfectly. My only complaints which are signicantly bothersome to me are that 1) you cannot tilt the screen at all. It is fixed in such a position that it catches glare from the window and 2) the volume is funky, when I turn it on or off there’s an indicator tone that blasts me out of the room, but when watching shows I have to turn it nearly full blast just to hear and even then I can’t hear it across the kitchen or with cooking going on. Now I know I don’t hear like I did when I was 20 but I’m not deaf either. There’s something not right about this volume control. I’ve had this for a couple months now and will settle for it but wish I’d returned it honestly. The picture is just sort of average. No complaints but it didn’t strike me as anything above average. The price was good though.

We have good luck with LG products in the past, so we bought this set from Amazon.  It has a great picture and decent sound.The setup instructions were poor and confusing.  Our cable company tech solved the minor issue which involved seeing the picture.It's all good now.
