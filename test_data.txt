This hoodie runs VERY small, the material isn't the best and the stripes look painted on. Not to mention it came late, however, it is warm. It's rather comfortable, and is good for the fall.The ribbon that tightens the hood is nothing but a shoelace threaded through the hood. I'd suggest getting the largest size if you are 5'0 +.Overall I'm not upset with this purchase.

maybe it's the screen settings over 6 different devices but the product online looks a lot darker, almost maroon, what we got was a bright red sweater, my daughter found this on amazon and asked me to order it, size was medium but after taking a look at the rest of the information these are in asian sizes, now i always tell her to look at all the information including reviews, she didnt.the reason why i gave 5 stars is because the item sent is what was advertised and no fault of the store.The sweater looks great but will not fit my daughter because it's too small.I will not be returning it, for $10 it's just not worth the hassle. i suggested my daughter give it to one of her nieces, I'm sure she will like it.This garment ships from China and took almost a month to arrive so if you're in no hurry for it then you're good to go.

Online the color looks burgundy. It was a strange red color. The white stripes were stuck and I had to pull it apart which resulted in part of the shiny color coming off. The picture it appears is a full size sweatshirt it's not it's like a belly sweatshirt. I ordered XL it was probably a Junior's Medium. Shipping took forever that I had forgotten I had even ordered it. I ended up giving it to a 15 year old on my block vs throwing it away.

It says in the description that is made of cotton. Well, it’s 35% cotton and 65% made of the worst polyester. Feels like the polyester of the seventies. It feels horrible. Next is the size. They warn you about the difference in Asian, European and US sizes. I thought I compensated for that. Still way too small. Lastly, the stripes on the arms are a huge problem. They left white smudges on everything they touched. I will include pictures.

I ordered this sweat shirt in a 3X because I usually wear an XL and I read that they run small, but unfortunately the 3X was still too small. it fits but it's hard to move my arms and it's tight in some areas, I plan to give it to my friend who wears a Medium and it will probably be a little loose on her (how a hoodie should be). Also the material is not stretchable (I tried to stretch it because I like it so much) and it seems to be good quality especially for the price. I do recommend this but be leary of the sizing.

The picture on here is completely deceiving. You think you bought a burgundy red hoodie, but in reality you receive fire truck red. Yeah no thanks.Also the material is awful and it runs super small.

This is a really cute sweatshirt, and it fits very well (I bought a size larger than normal), but it's incredibly thin. I expected a thicker material when I ordered it, so when I put it on, it felt like a sweater, rather than a sweatshirt, Regardless of this though, I do not regret buying it. It will be better when it gets warmer outside and I can wear it alone, but at his point, I either wear it with a long sleeve underneath, or a jacket on top (I wear a bomber jacket over it.)

The picture shows the sweater as a maroon, when I received it, it was red and also fit like a size medium and I ordered an xl.
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


WAY off in size! XL fit my 9 yr old (it is big on her) but this certainly is NOT a woman's size XL! I understand that you get what you pay for but this is just ridiculous! I'm glad my daughter loves it though lol

Has a nice soft inside but is a little baggier than expected in the bust and stomach area.

Was nice, fit well and everything but when I washed it where it had the white rings towards the wrists it melted together in the wash and when I took it apart the white came off and just showed the red.
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


It's a cute sweatshirt but poorer quality. Not my favorite material. Still okay for the price. I am typically a small but I ordered a large.
<---> Actual -  neutral  , Expected -  positive <--->


This sweatshirt is absolutely amazing! It's very soft and the quality is great. I will definitely be getting another color.

I bought this pull over for my granddaughter I bought an extra large she's about a hundred and sixty five pounds and if it's really comfortable she loves it and the material is very nice
<---> Actual -  positive  , Expected -  positive <--->


White material on the sweatshirt cannot be dried. Looks like it will flake off after a short time. Not worth the money. Very small. Spoke to seller by e mail. Nothing came of it. Gave to my granddaughter but I’ve never seen her wear it.

it is very comfortable just a bit small but that was my fault I love it it is very nice to wear
<---> Actual -  positive  , Expected -  positive <--->


will never buy from here again. fabric feels like paper and its way to small a 2 year old could wear it bought for my 15 yo
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


The description had previously said that the material was cotton (I guess they changed it now after this incident) and when I got the product it also had a certain percentage of polyester in it. I had expected a cotton hoodie but what I got was a plastic feeling, stripes painted on, and untidy loose strings kind of sweater.

I know you get what you pay for, but this is ridiculous....even for Asian sizing this is way too small. I'm a small and I ordered a large and it wasn't even close...also the material is see through and scratchy, it gave me a slight rash when I took it off. Don't buy, I just sent a return request and have low faith they'll take it back.

Way too small

the proportions on this are super weird. i got a medium because i like my sweatshirts baggy but it was really short in the torso
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


For the price its just fine. I like the details on the arm. I'm 5'4 and 140#. I read the comments and went up 2 sizes. I always wear Medium but ordered an XL. Its a good fit. I just wish the arms were longer.
<---> Actual -  positive  , Expected -  positive <--->


Super cheaply made but you get what you paid for
<---> Actual -  neutral  , Expected -  negative <--->


Was too small. Also the bands on the arms felt uncomfortable and slightly restricted arm movement. When I bought it said free returns, contacted company to return item and they were very unwilling to take it back. Said it was not worth the money to ship it back to China.

love the style and the color but I went to an extra large once I was a small and thought it would be over sized but found it was a little small even for a 5.2 person so....

Not what I expected - I gave it away

I'm a large and I ordered an xxx-large and it fit!!! But if you know how you order Hoosier and you order one size larger well my Hoosier fits perfectly  but if there was a 4x I would have totally bought that
<---> Actual -  positive  , Expected -  positive <--->


Sooo disappointed,  I ordered 2 sizes up, and it was like a belly sweat shirt on me, I was so sad, because the material and quality was amazing. But this is not curvy girl friendly.
<---> Actual -  neutral  , Expected -  negative <--->


Daughter says it fits just perfect and is very soft and comfortable.
<---> Actual -  positive  , Expected -  positive <--->


If you order three sizes too big then the hoodie will fit. The material is soft and it looks just like the picture, but very small!
<---> Actual -  neutral  , Expected -  positive <--->


The shirt was a Christmas gift way to small! We got the dark red that looks maroon in the pic and it it bright red. So wrong color and too small! I should have read the reviews before I bought it. Also the material is cheep cheep. I will be paying close attention to reviews before I purchase anything else I would not buy this product if it were hanging in the rack
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  negative <--->


Package came when expected. color was brighter than picture, a bit small but I had low expectations from reading the other reviews. The fabric honestly doesn't bother me whatsoever. I would definitely buy again but in a bigger size. I haven't washed it yet but hopefully the decals don't wash off.  so far, it's Great!

The item was recently returned as it did not fit properly but more so because it was a t-shirt not a sweatshirt as the description states
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  neutral <--->


This is made from such a horrible and scratchy, low quality material. And I got a large because I wanted it to be a little big on me (I'm usually a medium) and it quite tight on me. I do not recommend.

We really didn't like the material.  Not what it looked like.

Fits good fyi don't put in the dryer the white stripes gets ruined

It’s cute, but not advertised as a crop top- which this is on me. I’m only 5’6” so that shouldn’t happen
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


And the material IS NOT cotton its something very uncomfortable and I won't wear it.
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


Great hoodie, it’s super soft and came very early! But I recommend that you buy one or two sizes up, I wear a sm/med so I bought an XL and it fits like perfect.
<---> Actual -  neutral  , Expected -  positive <--->


I bought this for my friend as a gift. Although, the tag said 2XL, the garment fit otherwise. The Smalls to Mediums are all right but above that buyer beware, the size lies.
<---> Actual -  neutral  , Expected -  positive <--->


Came with a black stain on the back shoulder and a snag in the material on the front side.  I would never recommend something like this.
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  negative <--->


Do not heat dry. Let it air dry. The white lines got glued together after I put in the dryer... It was completely ruined and now I can't wear it anymore.
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  neutral <--->


The color was great! It got washed & put in the dryer. The white stripes which are a plastic substance melted & stuck to each other. It is now unwearable.

Good

Love this hoodie, it's so cozy and warm and soft. This is my favorite hoodie to wear with some white baggy shorts! I recommend this hoodie so much!
<---> Actual -  positive  , Expected -  positive <--->


I ordered an XL of this sweatshirt to accommodate for the “too small” rating it received, as i'm normally a medium/large in sweatshirts. It fit way tighter than another medium sweatshirt that I own, it fit like a small. I am returning as i wanted a comfortabley baggy sweatshirt.
<---> Actual -  negative  , Expected -  positive <--->


Not a cotton material. It also has a shiny or glossy finish. I really would have preferred more of a matt finish.

Very mad at the fact a "large" fits like a small.. was really looking forward to wearing this on my trip this weekend.

More like a sweatshirt and not a hoodie. Other than that, it's nice.

Unfortunally, eventhoug I bought the XL size, the product is small.
